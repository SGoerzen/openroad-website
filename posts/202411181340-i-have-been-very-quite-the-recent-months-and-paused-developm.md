# I have been very quite the recent months and _paused_ development on SilkRust. You probably read the reason in the chat somewhere: I became a father.

However, this did not diminish my interest in the project in any way and as our child grows up I will find more time to continue development. Therefore, I would like to revive the spirit here a bit and have some news for you: **We decided to open source SilkRust.**
There are a few things I want to mention:
- Bevy 0.15 is about to release and I would like to migrate to it (we are currently still on 0.13) prior to open sourcing it
- We will move our repo to GitHub and probably rename the project
